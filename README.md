## Editing Slides
Located in [`index.md`](https://github.com/damonbauer/decompose-v2/blob/master/index.md).

Slides are separated by horizontal rules, using `---`.

### Slide Structure
You shouldn't have to worry about structuring content using cascading heading sizes or anything like that. [big](https://github.com/tmcw/big) will handle sizing the text.

### Images
Place any images in an `images` folder in the root folder so they can stay organized. Then it should be a [standard markdown image reference](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#images)

### Videos
Since Markdown can handle regular HTML, a standard YouTube embed _should_ work just fine.
