## Decomposition

Decompose: Break it up

---

# Shipping Large Units

* Lots of code
* Lots of testing
* Slow delivery to customers
* Discouragement and overwhelm

---

# Shipping Small Units

* A little bit of code
* A little bit of testing
* Deliver _something_ to customers
* Feedback and motivation

---

# When Decomposing Work

Find the smallest units of work that are:

* Shippable
* User-facing

## Decompose the _Problem_ not the _Solution_

* Is this feature even needed?
* Is there a simpler alternative?
* What's the smallest, shippable, user-facing change we can make?

---

## Plan First

* _What?_
* _Why?_
* _How?_
* _Where?_

---

## _What?_

* Design and architecture work done before touching a single line of code.

---

## _Why?_

* Stay focused
* Collaboration
* Accountability / Peer Review
* More accurately reflect your work

---

## Stay Focused

* Up front design work helps prevent you from getting sidetracked while coding.

---

## Collaboration

* A design helps immensely when someone else has to pick up work you didn't complete.

---

## Accountability / Peer Review

* A design review allows your team to help course-correct your work before you waste too much time on the wrong thing.

---

## More accurately reflect your work

* By dragging your ticket into `Architecture & Design` before `Develop`, Jira can more accurately capture what you're actually spending your time on.

---

## _How?_
* Text / Markdown
* Diagrams

Whatever helps express to your team, what you intend to do, and how you intend to do it.
