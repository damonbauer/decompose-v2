## What?

* Design and architecture work done before touching a single line of code.

---

## Why?

* Stay focused
* Collaboration
* Accountability / Peer Review
* More accurately reflect your work

---

## Stay Focused

* Up front design work helps prevent you from getting sidetracked while coding.

---

## Collaboration

* A design helps immensely when someone else has to pick up work you didn't complete.

---

## Accountability / Peer Review

* A design review allows your team to help course-correct your work before you waste too much time on the wrong thing.

---

## More accurately reflect your work

* By dragging your ticket into `Architecture & Design` before `Develop`, Jira can more accurately capture what you're actually spending your time on.

---

## How?
* Text / Markdown
* Diagrams

Whatever helps express to your team, what you intend to do, and how you intend to do it.
